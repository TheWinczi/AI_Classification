# AI Supervised learning from data - Classification

---

## Description
- Program using machine learning classification algorithm has to decide, based on the sensor data vector, whether an explosion has occurred or not.
- As part of learning 4 different classification algorithms was used and compared:

1. KNN
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. SVN

## Train and test data description
- Data used to train and test describe values read from the sensors and decision of two values - explosive or non-explosive.
- train data shape (312, 114)
- test data shape (104, 114)
