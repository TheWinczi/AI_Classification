# AI Supervised learning from data - Classification
***Created in June 2021***

---

## Description
- Program using machine learning classification algorithm has to decide, based on the sensor data vector, whether an explosion has occurred or not.
- As part of learning 4 different classification algorithms was used and compared:

1. **KNN**
2. **Decision Tree**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **SVN**

## Train and test data
- Data used to train and test describe values read from the sensors and decision of two values - explosive or non-explosive.
- train data shape (312, 114)
- test data shape (104, 114)

## Results
Algorithm       | max accuracy I reached    |
 -------------- | ------------------------- |
KNN             |           00.0%           |
Decision Tree   |           00.0%           |
Random Forest   |           00.0%           |
SVN             |           00.0%           |
